          Although I have not always had projects to work on, I have found a few since starting my professional career. Each of these projects has been enjoyable to learn from and optimize.

          <h3>App to access Material Safety Data Sheet</h3>
          <p>
            I developed an app using Microsoft Power Apps that launches when a QR code is scanned, displaying a material safety data sheet for all supplied goods. <br>
            By clicking on a product name, users can access a PDF stored on Microsoft SharePoint, providing more detailed information about the product.<br>
            This is a screenshot of what the app looked like!

          <h3>Website to access Material Safety Data Sheet</h3>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, the app did not meet all the requirements, as it needed to be accessible to everyone in case of an emergency, and Power Apps only grants access to people within your organization.<br>
            With this limitation in mind, I decided to learn web development to recreate the app as a website.<br>

          <h3>Work In Progress - Python script to convert Excel data into HTML</h3>
          <p>
            If I transition from my current job, I want to ensure that this website remains up to date. <br>
            To facilitate this for myself and anyone who succeeds me, I plan to create a Python script that converts the relevant data from the Excel MSDS workbook to HTML.
